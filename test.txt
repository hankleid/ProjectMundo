Although rectangular cross-sections are a major step toward diamond integrated circuits, this fabrication technique comes with its own geometric constraints, such as limitations on the range of fabricable feature sizes, which originate from a strong correlation of the initial etch depth and undercut thin-film area. Traditional photonic designs that do not account for fabrication constraints are thus unable to take full advantage of this new fabrication technique.

   In this work, we overcome these fabrication and design challenges by employing inverse design methods. In silicon nanophotonics these methods have recently attracted considerable attention for their efficient design of devices with superior performance over conventional designs

   . We showcase the potential of inverse design techniques for diamond integrated circuits by designing and fabricating several devices: a compact vertical coupler, an essential component for large-scale quantum photonic systems, and a small circuit consisting of inverse-designed vertical couplers and waveguide-splitters acting as interfaces for two nanoresonators. Our inverse-designed vertical coupler adheres to the diamond fabrication constraints and outperforms commonly used free-space interfaces. The fabricated devices show excellent agreement with simulations in terms of both performance and yield. In the second example, we illustrate the integration of such a vertical coupler into a diamond photonic circuit consisting of two nanobeam resonators connected via inverse-designed waveguide-splitters—a configuration that could be used to entangle two quantum emitters embedded inside such resonators.

The data in red correspond to the device with vertical couplers, while the black spectrum corresponds to a cavity with notches as the free-space interface for the same input power and integration time. The count rates of the device with notches as an interface are more than two orders of magnitude smaller, for which we compensate by integrating ten times longer (data in green). When comparing the cavity resonances (blue arrows), we find a &gt;550-fold increase in counts of the vertical coupler over the notch device for comparable quality factors (

    ≈ 4000). This result matches well with the 625-fold enhancement that we expect from simulations. This improvement in coupling efficiencies allows for dramatically decreased experimental times (in some cases from weeks to minutes of photon integration), thereby opening opportunities for larger-scale experiments. In Fig.
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">

    we present spectra, where we couple the laser light directly to the cavity and optimize the alignment to collect maximum counts from the vertical coupler (red) and the notch (green). From this measurement, we can conclude that the extraction efficiency of light coupling from the cavity mode to the waveguide is ≈24 times greater for a vertical coupler than that for a notch, which corresponds well to the transmission experiment.

    . This requires the excitation of emitters in multiple cavities, the interference of their emission on beamsplitters, and subsequently the efficient collection and detection of photons. However, up until now elements such as waveguide-splitters have posed a major challenge in suspended diamond photonics, as state-of-the-art fabrication using angled etch is not conducive to variations in the device geometry. In contrast, as shown in Fig.

    , we can fabricate a conceptual circuit comprised of three components with completely different geometries: vertical couplers, waveguide-splitters, and nanobeam PhC cavities. The device is designed to interfere the transmission of two nanobeam PhC cavities at an inverse-designed waveguide-splitter with a 50:50 splitting ratio and simulated efficiencies of 95%. We address the cavities separately or simultaneously by top-down excitation with a supercontinuum source focused on the cavities directly, as presented in Fig.

    . Comparing the amplitudes of the cavity on and off resonance suggests constructive interference, indicating that the cavities are approximately in phase and have the same polarization. With this concept circuit, we show that inverse design can overcome limitations of classical photonics and enables large-scale on-chip quantum optics experiments. Extending this work, we can increase compactness by combining several functionalities into a single device, design circuits for arbitrary emitter locations, assure phase-matching across different paths of the circuits, and optimize for specific bandwidths. Such a platform can then utilize the scalability that diamond color centers offer: site-controlled implantation of high-quality color centers

The back-reflector distance to the coupler (400 nm and 650 nm) is significantly shorter than the photon wave-packet and optimized to match the phase between reflected and directly coupled photons. These findings are encouraging for the development of highly efficient and compact photonic free-space interfaces as an alternative to fiber tapers for quantum photonic applications at the single-photon level. Moreover, many experiments will require optical driving of individual emitters to compensate for their spectral broadening via Raman processes
