The back-reflector distance to the coupler (400\u2009nm and 650\u2009nm) is significantly shorter than the photon wave-packet and optimized to match the phase between reflected and directly coupled photons. These findings are encouraging for the development of highly efficient and compact photonic free-space interfaces as an alternative to fiber tapers for quantum photonic applications at the single-photon level. Moreover, many experiments will require optical driving of individual emitters to compensate for their spectral broadening via Raman processes.",
